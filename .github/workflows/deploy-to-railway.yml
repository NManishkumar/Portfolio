# NOTES:
# - Before enabling this workflow, add the GitHub repository secret RAILWAY_API_KEY (a Railway personal API key).
# - Optionally add RAILWAY_PROJECT_ID and RAILWAY_SERVICE_ID if you want to target a specific Railway project/service.
# - This workflow installs the Railway CLI and runs `railway up` — it requires that the Railway API key has deploy permissions.
